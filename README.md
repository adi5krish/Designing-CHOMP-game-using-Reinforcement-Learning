# Designing-CHOMP-game-using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project is done as part of the course Artificial Intelligence offered in FALL 2017. 
Created a game named “CHOMP” with use of reinforcement learning.
Code was made in Python using a renowned algorithm namely “Monte Carlo Tree Search”. 
 
This is a 2-player game where one player is the computer. Computer outperformed humans after playing a fair number of games explainig the fact that the machine has learnt how to play the game.
